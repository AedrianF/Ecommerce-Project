# Ecommerce-Project

This is our project designing and implementing a full-stack e-commerce website. The project involved user authentication, secure login/sign-up, and a persistent shopping cart system. I integrated payment processing using the PayPal API, developed RESTful APIs to manage user data and operations, and built the front-end with Bootstrap and the back-end with JavaScript and MySQL.
